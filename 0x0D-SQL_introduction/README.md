# Introduction to SQL

In this project, I was introduced to **SQL** which refers to Structured Query Language. MySQL is an open-source database management system, commonly installed as part of the popular LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack. It implements the relational model and uses Structured Query Language (better known as SQL) to manage its data.

## Databases
A *database* is simply a collection of organized data. Also, a solid database will provide strong performance (because I/O is your bottleneck and databases are I/O, so their performance makes a whole lot more of a difference than the performance of your applicationâ€™s code) and scalability (inserting one user in a collection of 5 users should take about the same time as inserting one user in a collection of 5 billion users).

### Types of Database
There are two kinds of databases namely:
  1. Relational Database e.g MySQL
  2. Non-relational database:(composed of document-based, key-value stores) e.g. MongoDb
