# INHERITANCE IN PYTHON

Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

## Benefits of Inheritance
1. It represents real-world relationships well.
2. It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

### Syntax
*Class BaseClass:*
*    {Body}*
Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
*    {Body}*

In this project, I learned about class inheritance, defining multiple parent classes and overiding using the super() method.
