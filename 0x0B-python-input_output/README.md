# INPUT/OUPUT IN PYTHON

In this project, I learned about input and output in python. Key areas discussed include:
	1. How to open a file
	2. How to wite a text in a file
	3. How to read the full content of a file and also line by line
	4. How to make sure a file is closed
	5. What is JSON and working with it

The projects were done solely by Salmon Mbuchi and they are listed as follows:
	
	1. **0-read_file.py**: Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout

	2. **1-write_file.py**: Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written

	3. **2-append_write.py**: Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added

	4. **3-to_json_string.py**: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)

	5. **4-from_json_string.py**: Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string

	6. **5-save_to_json_file.py**: Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation

	7. **6-load_from_json_file.py**: Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”

	8. **7-add_item.py**: Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file

	9. **8-class_to_json.py**: Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object

	10. **9-student.py**: Write a class Student

	11. **10-student.py**: Write a class Student

	12. **12-pascal_triangle.py**: Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n
