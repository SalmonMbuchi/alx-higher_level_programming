# Almost a Circle

In this project, I incorporated all concepts covered so far in the Python Language. This includes:
	1. Import
	2. Exceptions
	3. Class
	4. Private Attribute
	5. Getter/Setter
	6. Class method
	7. Static method
	8. Inheritance
	9. Unittest
	10. Read/Write file
	11. args and kwargs
	12. Serialization/Deserialization
	13. JSON
Unittests were required as a part of the project. A mandatory manual review upon completion of the tasks by peers or technical staff was required.
